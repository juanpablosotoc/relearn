After what happened that day, my life changed forever. When I was 13 years old my parents decided that my brothers should go to another state to study university even though this would mean that the family would be separated and we might not be completely reunited ever again. I remained silent as my brothers packed their belongings and I soon realized that they had grown up and that they were making a life of their own, a life in which I was not going to play a primary role in. I said my goodbyes and watched as they drove away. I returned inside to a cold, empty residence, one that wasn't much of a home anymore.
