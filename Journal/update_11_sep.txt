Apparently, removing Nacel as my legal guardian here in France is going to be possible. 

However, things start to get a little bit tricky and a lot of different possibilities start to show up.

- What if I quit the host family and remain with my brother during the months and afterwards I find an apartment?
- What if I decide to stay the majority of my time with my host family but sometimes with Andres?
- What if, what if, what if....



There is one main benefit from this idea: It gives me the freedom to chose my legal guardian.
And that my friend changes everything.
With that power, if used correctly, I could live as I wish to live.


I will speak to my father and mother and see what they think, see you.
