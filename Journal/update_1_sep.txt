Today was my first day attending the internship and the school.
School starts tomorrow.

I have made a couple of friends however I am doubtful of a couple of them,
I don't know if they will really be my friends.
I experienced the internship for the first time today. It was awful.
Although I did make a couple of friends at the internship, I am doubtful
Of a lot of them. 

Furthermore, my actual experience here in the internship is 
really getting to me. It is getting on my nerves.
The conditions in the internship are the following:
- No use of cellphone during hours were a teacher might see you
- No going up to your room whenever you please, the rooms are locked
Until the staff decides to unlock them, for the most part this happens at 8pm.
- No exiting the internship. The only time where you can exit the internship
Is Wednesday after classes and you must return at 8pm I believe. 
The only way to get around this is by doing sport outside of the 
Internship at some establishment and proving this to the school.
- No internet (I can't program)  
- Whenever I can enter my room it is not private, the staff can come in and out 
whenever they please.


I am not used to this kind of lifestyle where most of my personal interests
Are blocked by rules. Rules that an establishment who is constantly watching 
Over me have established.

I see one way around it: Speaking with Nacel and staying with the host family all
Of the time and trying to get along much better with the host family.
However, this would come with a cost:
- Large transportation every day to go to the school and come back (1hr to go. 2hrs round trip)

And the benefit?
The benefit would be VERY VERY large. All of the restrictions that I have listed would only
Apply to school hours and after that, I can do as I please.
