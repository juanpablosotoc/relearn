I am actually starting to like staying at the internship. 

Oh and Nacel told me to fuck off, the other plan failed, if I would have proceeded they would have personally escorted me to my international flight back to Mexico. Fucking hell. Que buen desvergue les arme.

However, this might have been for the best. I don't feel as if I failed for some reason. 

Furthermore, I got another idea, however this idea no longer involves leaving Nacel, the internship or the host family. In fact it is a very simple plan and the probabilities of it failing are  minimal.
The idea is the following:
The internship allows students to leave if they have some sort of extracurricular activity and a signed petition from the legal tutor. 
I believe that in fact I would be taking the best out of both worlds. If I could get unlimited internet I could get crazy efficient at the internship and sleep less since they will wake me up and furthermore I would get to party on the weekends with Andres (Hopefully, assuming that he and I can make the host family trust him). And furthermore, during the week I could exit the internship, take a metro to a Starbucks on front of the Tour Eiffel and program until 21h (I have to be back at 22h).

Relejate Juan Pablo, todo esta saliendo, quizás no como planeado mas sin embargo, por alguna razón todo se esta arreglando perfectamente.
