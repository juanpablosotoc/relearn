Tried to change schools, Kathy was unable to do so. She politely tried to help but unfortunately the school rejected. However, I am currently running the process to change form the internship to the host family.

I am actually starting to like the school. Not only do I get very much along with all of the students but I am actually starting to like the classes. Maybe not having changed schools was best. 

I am not mad that I couldn't change schools, in fact, for some reason, I think I succeeded, I get along with most of the students and the girls and I am starting to get along with a lot of girls.

In fact, now that I am here, I am actually starting to see some benefits of staying in Saint Nicolas.
The only downside that I now see is the amount of Time that it would take me to move from the host family t the internship. However, if can get really efficient it would take me 1 hour to transport myself. This wouldn't be that bad. For example: Tuesday I finish school at 2:30, then I could go to McDonalds programa for an hour, or go out with a girl to eat, go visit Paris, the possibilities are endless.
