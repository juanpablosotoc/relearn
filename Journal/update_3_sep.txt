Today is the first weekend staying with the host family after the internship. 

Things are getting a little bit difficult. There is a large problem
That I need to solve. 


The conditions at the internship are not habitable as a great experience, 
Therefore, if I want to live a habitable and good experience
I need to exit the internship and remain with the host family. 

I have spoken with Nacel and the host family and this option is very much
Plausible and possible. 
However, it would come with one catch:
I would need to travel 1h20 every day just to go the school and another 1h20
To come back to the host family. This would cause a lot of issues. 



My host family has proposed another solution: That I remain with them during 
The whole week and that I change schools to Lycée Descartes. This school
Is a public one and it is 10 minutes away from my house by foot. 

This option would seem very much plausible, however, I have spoken with Nacel and
They told me that the would probably not be able to arrive at a legal agreement
With this other school. 
Such that if I were to change schools this would leave me 
Out of the Nacel program. 
It would be as if I was just a student that came to France
On his own, found a host family and a school. 

I am okey with this solution
Since It's not like I would be gaining much if I remain with Nacel.
However leaving the Nacel program would make the execution of this solution
A lot more difficult:
- I would have to go through the whole acceptance 
  Process at Lycée Descartes on my own.
- My student visa might get a little funky since the embassy accepted the visa 
  If I study at Saint Nicolas, not Lycée Descartes
- If I have anymore issues Nacel would not be able to protect me. Ex:
  My host family kicks me out for some reason, Nacel finds another one.
- The host family would have to be okey with me leaving the program.
