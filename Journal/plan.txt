Now that I have started to successfully navigate and find great pleasure in the situation in which I am in, a big question pops up in my head: 
What am I going to do during my stay in France?

Or more precisely, how am I going to structure my days to get the most out of the situation?

The best way I can think of doing this is defining an ordered schedule and plan for every day of the week.

- Monday 19h30:
- Tuesday 14h30:
- Wednesday 19h30:
- Thursday 14h30:
- Friday 14h30:
- Saturday:
- Sunday:
