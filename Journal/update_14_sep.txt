I have proceded to try to leave Nacel. I have contacted both the Nacel team in France as well as my agent in Mexico (Gaby De Los Reyes). 
If this solution is successful it would be wonderful.
Furthermore, I believe I have a solution for the problem that might arise when Andres leaves France: 
Donald.

It is possible and very likely that he has contacts here in Paris with which he could get in contact to find an apartment with someone of his trust that is overage.


For now, I am concentrating on leaving Nacel and re-enrolling in Saint Nicolas but now with Andres as the legal guardian.
