I don't know what to say.

I am feeling pretty good about my advancements in French, I believe I'm progressing pretty well.
 
As far as school goes, I might decide to tell the school that I am not going to worry about my grades and that they shouldn't watch them ()they shouldn't call nor the host family nor my real family if I'm not doing well), they are going to say that need to call Nacel, in which case I will send them authorization from my parents. 

I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by my responsibilities:
- School HW
- University
- Web App
