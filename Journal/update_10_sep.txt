Fucking hell

I just can't run out of ideas.

I won't do a little intro this time and I will get right to it

PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
- lack of freedom

The solution is simple, however it is divided into two transactions in which if the second fails, I will still execute the first one.


Solution:
Remove Nacel as the legal tutor in the school and quit the Nacel program such that the host family will be contacting my family in Mexico directly. 

Steps:
Transaction 1:
- See if I can remove Nacel as the legal tutor and place someone else instead (my brother)
- Change from the internship to the host family
Transaction 2:
- Remain with the host family during a couple of weeks
- See if they will allow me to sleep in my brothers department most of the time (do this gradually)


It is one hell of a plan.
I already have my brothers approval to do so.
Now the step that has the highest probability of failing is removing Nacel as the legal tutor but we will see.


Peace
